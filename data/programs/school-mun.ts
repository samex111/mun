    body: "The SMJMUN School Association Program is a comprehensive educational initiative designed to help schools provide their students with a world-class Model United Nations experience without the complexities of organising and managing an event independently. Through a structured five-day experience comprising professional delegate training and a fully managed conference, students develop communication skills, leadership qualities, research capabilities, confidence, teamwork, and critical thinking abilities that extend far beyond the classroom.\n\nAt SMJMUN, we believe education should not simply prepare students for examinations — it should prepare them for life. As our philosophy states: MUN teaches you how to speak. SMJMUN exists to give you something worth saying.",

Day 1 covers the foundations — Introduction to MUN, understanding committees and agendas, rules of procedure, research methodology, country portfolio preparation, position paper guidance, and conference readiness. Day 2 focuses on communication — public speaking fundamentals, committee flow and delegate strategy, motions and procedures, negotiation and lobbying, resolution drafting, and confidence building exercises.",
